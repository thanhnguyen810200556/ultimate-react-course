# ðŸ§  The Ultimate React Course 2025 â€“ Projects Collection

Welcome to my project collection from the [Ultimate React Course 2025](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. This course covers everything from React fundamentals to advanced topics such as Next.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and more.

This repository serves as a central hub linking to all the individual projects I built while following the course. Each project has its own GitHub repository and README for further details.
